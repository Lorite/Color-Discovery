0. random color
1. gold
2. silver
3. bronze
4. diamond
5. emerald
6. ruby
7. sapphire
9. change color mode

## ---- Modes ----
*Default mode is set to default mode. In this mode all blocks light up at the same time*
* Set default mode with 'q'
* Set auto mode 1 with 'w'
* Set auto mode 1 with 'e'
* Set following mouse mode with 'i'
* Set random mode with 'o'
* Set pause/unpause with 'p'

## ---- Color Modes ----
*Default color mode is set to default mode. In this mode the hue and saturation for all blocks is the same*
* **** The variable is *colourMode* because p5.js already uses *colorMode*
* The other mode is random where the color changes randomly over time
* Swap between default and random color modes with 9

* Change the width of the canvas by +-5 with 'z'

* Change the number of horizontal blocks by +1 with 'c'
