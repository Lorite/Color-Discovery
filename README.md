## ---- Colors ----
Colors can be changed by pressing numbers from 0 to 9 where:<br />
0: random color<br />
1: gold<br />
2: silver<br />
3: bronze<br />
4: diamond<br />
5: emerald<br />
6: ruby<br />
7: sapphire<br />
8: amethyst<br />
9: automatically change color mode

## ---- Modes ----
*Default mode is set to default mode. In this mode all blocks light up at the same time*
* Set default mode with 'q'
* Set auto mode 1 with 'w'
* Set auto mode 2 with 'e'
* Set following mouse mode with 'i'
* Set random mode with 'o'
* Set pause/unpause with 'p'

## ---- Color Modes ----
*Default color mode is set to default mode. In this mode the hue and saturation for all blocks is the same*
* **** The variable is *colourMode* because p5.js already uses *colorMode*
* The other mode is random where the color changes randomly over time
* Swap between default and random color modes with 9

## ---- Variables ----
*By pressing the corresponding key + mouse scroll wheel*
* Change the width of the canvas by +-5 with 'z'
* Change the height of the canvas by +-5 with 'x'
* Change the number of horizontal blocks by +1 with 'c'
* Change the number of vertical blocks by +1 with 'v'
* Change how fast the blocks change color by +-0.2 with 'b'
* Change the lighting size by +-1 with 'n'
